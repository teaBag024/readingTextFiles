Driving through West Virginia
And I've seldom been thinner
With that chip on my shoulder
And this past year I got so much older

Looking back over my life
Spent the most of it tongue-tied
And I wish I'd had more time
Listening to you speak your mind

Now I'm thinking 'bout her every day
On my mind atypical way
Are you a life force?
Thinking 'bout her every day
On my mind atypical way
Are you a life force?

Drinking coffee black as iron
And I couldn't be much higher
Without falling out of my chair
I've been so numb for so many years

Now I'm thinking 'bout her every day
On my mind atypical way
Are you a life force?
Thinking 'bout her every day
On my mind atypical way
Are you a life force?

And it's so easy
To be blinded by the light
To feel lonely in the night
And it's blowing in the breeze babe
I got dust in my eyes
And rust in my mind
I'll be home come next spring
Won't you say you love me later
By and by

Looking back over my life
Spent the most of it tongue-tied
Pullin' my belt tight
It's just me and the stars tonight
Two fingers and a tight line
Keep my head above the alpine
Just wish I had more time
Listening to her speak her mind

Thinking 'bout her every day
On my mind atypical way
Are you a life force?
I'm thinking 'bout her every day
On my mind atypical way
Are you a life force?
I'm thinking 'bout her every day
On my mind atypical way
Are you a life force?
I'm thinking 'bout her every day
On my mind atypical way
Are you a life force?
