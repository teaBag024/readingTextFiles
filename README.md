# Practice Quest: Read Me

- Read in the text-file labeled `somenums.txt`
    - this file is located in the resources folder of the project
    - the data from this file should be saved into an appropriate array
- Read in the text-file labeled `somewords.txt`
    - this file is located in the root of the project
    - the data in this file is separated by two --
        - you should use the split method to get the data into single values
    - the data from this file should be saved into an appropriate array
- Once all data is read in create an ArrayList that alternates the values from each of the arrays you read in
